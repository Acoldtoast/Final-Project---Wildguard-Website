Once widespread in the Visayas, its population dropped sharply after more than 95% of forests in Negros and Panay were cleared for farming and settlements. With less forest cover, the pigs are more easily hunted, and many now mix with domestic pigs, causing genetic loss. Conservation efforts include captive-breeding programs in local and international zoos, along with community awareness campaigns.
